# Project Design:
Examine and identify differentially expressed genes in *Vitis vinifera* following varying chemical treatments.

# Guidance:
If you are looking at this body of code for guidance, please examine my other similar project at [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EdgerLab/Blueberry_RNA_Seq_Expression_Analysis) as it is a little more well documented. However, on this project I calculated FPKM, and I have not done that for the other project.
