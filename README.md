# Project Design

## Project 1:
### Sample Abbreviations:
(Hereafter x = original sample name)

* W_C_x = water control (made of H2O only), 
* GA3_CK_C_x = control for gibberellin and cytokinin inhibitor treatments (made of H2O + 1 % DMSO), 
* AUX_C_x = control for auxin inhibitor treatment (made of H2O + 1 % DMSO + 0.2 % EtOH),  
* GA3_x = gibberellin treatment (in H2O + 1 % DMSO),
* CK_x = cytokinin inhibitor treatment (in H2O + 1 % DMSO),
* AUX_x = auxin inhibitor treatment (in H2O + 1 % DMSO + 0.2 % EtOH) .

### Comparisons Desired:
Here two different comparisons could be of interest, one way more important that the other:
* Controls vs. treatments (top priority) – compare GA3 and CK with GA3_CK_C and compare AUX with AUX_C: determine the effect of the treatment on gene expression.
* Controls only (not priority, maybe not even necessary; we can talk about this when the priority one has been completed) – compare GA3_CK_C and AUX_C with W_C: determine the effect of DMSO and DMSO + EtOH on gene expression.


## Project 2:
### Sample Abbreviations:
(Hereafter x = biorep number 1, 2, or 3)
* SB-C-x = untransformed control without galls,
* SB-CK-x-G = untransformed control with 5-day-old galls,
* DPR-x = empty vector control without galls,
* DPR-x-G = empty vector control with 5-day-old galls,
* Code starting with 1 = transformed plant, WUS knockdown in region 1 without galls,
* Code starting with 1 and finishing by -G = transformed plant, WUS knockdown in region 1, with 5-day-old-galls,
* Code starting with 2 = transformed plant, WUS knockdown in region 2 without galls,
* Code starting with 2 and finishing by -G  = transformed plant, WUS knockdown in region 2, with 5-day-old-galls,
* Code starting with 3 = transformed plant, LFY knockdown in region 1 without galls,
* Code starting with 3 and finishing by -G  = transformed plant, LFY knockdown in region 1, with 5-day-old-galls,
* Code starting with 4 = transformed plant, LFY knockdown in region 2 without galls,
* Code starting with 4 and finishing by -G  = transformed plant, LFY knockdown in region 2, with 5-day-old-galls,

### Comparisons Desired:
Here we need to find a way to determine whether the genes WUS and LFY were really knocked out in the transformed plants. So here again two different comparisons could be of interest, one way more important that the other:
* Transformed vs. untransformed (top priority) – compare WUS1 and WUS2 with SB-C and compare LFY1 and LFY2 with SB-C: determine whether the two target genes were knocked down.
* Ungalled vs. galled when data available for both within the same genotype (not priority, maybe not even necessary; we can talk about this when the priority one has been completed) – compare SB-CK-G with SB-C, compare DPR-G with DPR, compare 1-G with 1, compare 2-G with 2, compare 3-G with 3, and compare 4-G with 4: determine the effect of galling on gene expression in different genotypes.
